## Setup/Installation Requirements

- [ ] Clone this repository
- [ ] Create new branch to make changes to code
- [ ] Open files in atom or text editor of your choice
- [ ] Open in a browser of your choice

## Database Setup Instructions

- [ ] Install PG gem by typing "gem install pg" in to your terminal.
- [ ] Type "bundle" in to your terminal.
- [ ] Type "psql" in to your terminal to open postgres psql.
- [ ] You are now in the default database from here you can create a new database.
- [ ] Type the following statements in psql:

* CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker;
* \c volunteer_tracker
* CREATE TABLE "projects" ("id"  SERIAL, "project_title" VARCHAR, PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
* CREATE TABLE "volunteers" ("id"  SERIAL, "volunteer_name" VARCHAR, "project_id" INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
* ALTER TABLE "volunteers" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("project_id") REFERENCES "projects" ("id");

You may also want to create a test database that mirrors the actual database for running tests as you build your program.
To do that type the following statement in psql.

* CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker_test WITH TEMPLATE volunteer_tracker;

If you make changes to the original database, volunteer_tracker, you will want to delete your test database and then recreate it with the template of the updated original.

To do this tupe the following statements in psql:
* From the original database, if you are not in the original database navigate to it now using the statement:
* \c volunteer_tracker
now you may delete the test database and then recreate it by typing:
* DROP DATABASE volunteer_tracker_test;
* CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker_test WITH TEMPLATE volunteer_tracker;
